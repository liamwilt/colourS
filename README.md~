This program contains a spectrum of stimuli designed to assess and train eye hand coordination.

Eye hand coordination is the visual processing of information to guide hand movements. Eye hand coordination is necessary for a variety of typical activities like grasping a cup or using a pencil. Poor eye hand coordination accompanies many syndromes and conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, decreased muscle tone, and certain visual disorders like optic ataxia.

Deficient eye hand coordination is often the sum of neuro-physiological disturbances and can be treated through strengthening the oculo-manual muscle structures. By way of this therapy, one may similarly strengthen the neural pathways that sequence visual information with hand movements. Developing eye hand coordination skills may also catalyze downstream improvements of other motor capacities.
