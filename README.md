# Details
The Colours program contains a spectrum of stimuli designed to assess and train eye hand coordination.

Eye hand coordination is the effortful concatenation of eye movement with hand movement - it is a skill developed by way of visual input guiding manual tasks (e.g. grasping, reaching) and manual proprioception guiding visual tasks (e.g. gaze control, focus). 

Poor eye hand coordination accompanies many syndromes and conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, decreased muscle tone, and certain visual disorders like optic ataxia.

Deficient eye hand coordination is often the sum of neuro-physiological disturbances. Treatment may be as simple as strengthening the oculo-manual muscle structures and thereby the neural pathways that sequence visual information with hand movements. Developing eye hand coordination skills may also catalyze downstream improvements of other motor capacities.
