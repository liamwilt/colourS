This application package contains a spectrum of stimuli designed to assess and train eye tracking or eye-hand coordination.

Eye-hand coordination is the visual processing of information to guide hand movements. Eye-hand coordination is necessary for a variety of daily, routine activitiesâ€”from picking up a book to using a pencil. Poor eye-hand coordination accompanies many syndromes and conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, decreased muscle tone, and certain visual disorders like optic ataxia.

Eye-hand coordination difficulties are typically physiological in nature and can be treated through strengthening 1) the fine muscles of the hands and eyes and 2) the neural pathways that sequence visual information with hand movements. Additionally, as eye-hand coordination is often accompanied by other fine and gross motor deficits, developing eye-hand coordination skills may also catalyze the improvement of other motor capabilities.
