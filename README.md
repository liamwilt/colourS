# Details
*Colours* is a therapeutic program that contains a spectrum of stimuli designed to assess and train eye hand coordination.

Eye hand coordination is the effortful concatenation of eye movement with hand movement. It allows visual input to guide manual tasks (e.g. grasping, reaching) and manual proprioception to guide visual tasks (e.g. gaze control, focus). 

Poor eye hand coordination accompanies many syndromes and conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, decreased muscle tone, and visual disorders like optic ataxia.

Deficient eye hand coordination is often the sum of neuro-physiological disturbances and can be treated by strengthening the oculo-manual muscles. Prolonged therapy may also reinforce the neural pathways that sequence visual input with hand movement, opening a number of downstream motor capacities, both gross and fine, to improvement.
